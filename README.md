# Local development

Use `make` command to build a local `test` version of the container
```
make build

# Tools versions and upgrades

All tools' version are managed in the `Makefile` file. Change accordingly.
The `FROM` image version is **pinned** (in the `Dockerfile`) to ensure being able to have consistent builds.
